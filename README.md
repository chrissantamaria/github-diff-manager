# GitHub Diff Manager

A tiny Chrome extension providing quality-of-life improvements for code review.

Extension setup heavily inspired by [prettier-chrome-extension](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-chrome-extension) from the Prettier team.

## Todo

- Fully handle GitHub page transitions (some SPA magic is happening preventing the content script from always running)
- Dynamic regex filename matching from config
- Visual config editor from options
- Find more elegant way of targeting filename / reviewed toggle button
